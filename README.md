## Numpy Project 

For this project the student was asked to submit a Jupyter Notebook explaining the use of the ```numpy.random``` package. 

There were 4 distinct tasks to be carried out within this. <br>
- Explain the overall package
- Explain the use of "simple random data" and "permutations"
- Explain the use and purpose of 5 distributions within the package 
- Explain the use of seeding when generating random numbers. 

This notebook is broken down via the headings above. Evidence of planning is shown via the commits to the repository.
