    "NumPy is an open-source package used by data scientists and is the universal standard for working with, and manipulating numerical data in Python.The NumPy API is used extensively in Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, scikit-image and most other data science and scientific Python packages.\n",
    "There are a number of distinct functions within the package that perform a wide variety of high- level mathematical operations on multidimensional numerical arrays. In recent years Numpy has become particularly important for machine learning and deep learning, as these often involve large datasets of numerical data. The cleaning and reshaping of data is a large part of the workflow when dealing with these datasets and nupmy can provide some excellent tools to aid in this data manipulation[1]  [4]\n",
    "Among these functions is the numpy.random package which can generate pseudo-random numbers. This is useful for many aspects of data analytics and machine learning projects, from randomly initialing weights in an artificial neural network, splitting data into random sets, or randomly shuffling your dataset, being able to generate random numbers (actually, repeatable pseudo-random numbers) is essential. **Random sampling is used in many tasks related to data analysis, statistics and other related fields, and is very commonly seen in probability, Bayesian statistics (“Bayesian statistics is a mathematical procedure that applies probabilities to statistical problems. It provides people the tools to update their beliefs in the evidence of new data.”), machine learning, among others  (Check this sentence out for improvements)**\n",

    "While python's in-built random package ```random``` can generate values, for larger arrays ```numpy.random``` is preferred as it can sample more than one value at a time. This isn't so much an issue for smaller arrays, but for larger there is a noticeably faster time differential in most cases.[3] The numpy package can also offer a few extra probability distributions, such as binomial, commonly used in scientific research, as well as a couple of convenience functions for generating arrays of random data. The random.random library is a little more lightweight, and generally not considered suitable for scientific research or other kinds of work in statistics. [2] "

    "Prior to the newest release of NumPy the method for calling these functions was through ```np.random.shuffle(x)``` or ```np.random.permutation(x)```; however since release 1.21 in June 2021 [7] the accepted method is now to import ```rng``` from the random package, as seen above, and use this in the function call instead. As of October 2021 the older method of calling this function is still working, but new users should be aware that this may become deprecated in the future.   \n",

It should be noted that this function will only shuffle the first axis of a multi-dimensional array (ie an array with more than one sub-arrays) by default. Since June 2021. shuffle now uses ```axis``` as an argument to manipulate the sub-arrays, ie if axis is set at 0 then only the first dimension of arrays will shuffle around. However if it is set to 1 or any other sub-array level, then the first level will set as they were and it is only the values in the dimension called that will move. As this can be a difficult thing to abstractly visualise, I have laid out the following examples below to help visualise the dimensions. \n",
