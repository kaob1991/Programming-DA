In recent years Numpy has become particularly important for machine learning and deep learning, as these often involve large datasets of numerical data. The cleaning and reshaping of data is a large part of the workflow when dealing with these datasets and numpy can provide some excellent tools to aid in this data manipulation[1]  [4]\n",

This is useful for many aspects of data analytics and machine learning projects, from randomly initialing weights in an artificial neural network, splitting data into random sets, or randomly shuffling your dataset, being able to generate random numbers (actually, repeatable pseudo-random numbers) is essential. **Random sampling is used in many tasks related to data analysis, statistics and other related fields, and is very commonly seen in probability, Bayesian statistics (“Bayesian statistics is a mathematical procedure that applies probabilities to statistical problems. It provides people the tools to update their beliefs in the evidence of new data.”), machine learning, among others  (Check this sentence out for improvements)**\n",

    "Distributions are collections of data, or scores, on a variable. It is a function that shows the possible values for a variable, and how often they occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution provides a parameterized mathematical function that can be used to calculate the probability for any individual observation from the sample space. This distribution describes the grouping or the density of the observations, called the probability density function, or PDF. We can also calculate the likelihood of an observation having a value equal to or lesser than a given value. A summary of these relationships between observations is called a cumulative density function, or CDF.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Many data samples conform to well-known and well-understood mathematical functions, such as the Gaussian distribution. A function can fit the data with a modification of the parameters of the function, such as the mean and standard deviation in the case of the Gaussian.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a distribution function is known, it can be used as a shorthand for describing and calculating related quantities, such as likelihoods of observations, and plotting the relationship between observations in the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Density Functions\n",
    "***\n",
    "Distributions are often described in terms of their density or density functions.These are functions that describe how the proportion of data or likelihood of the proportion of observations change over the range of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two types of density functions are probability density functions and cumulative density functions.These are continuous functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probability Density function:** calculates the probability of observing a given value. It can also be used to summarize the likelihood of observations across the distribution’s sample space. Plots of the PDF show the familiar shape of a distribution, such as the bell-curve for the Gaussian distribution. Distributions are often defined in terms of their probability density functions with their associated parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cumulative Density function:** calculates the probability of an observation equal or less than a value. Cumulative density function, or CDF, is a different way of thinking about the likelihood of observed values. The CDF calculates the cumulative likelihood for the observation and all prior observations in the sample space. It allows a user to quickly understand and comment on how much of the distribution lies before and after a given value. A CDF is often plotted as a curve from 0 to 1 for the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability\n",
    "The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1, where, roughly speaking, 0 indicates impossibility of the event and 1 indicates certainty. [3]\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Using the concept of a dice is one of the simplest ways to understand probability. It has six sides, numbered from 1 to 6. If the dice is rolled, the probability of getting 1 is one in 6, i.e. one-sixth. This is also true for the other 5 sides. The probability of getting a 7, which obviously is impossible, is 0. The distribution consists not only of the input values that can be observed, but is made up of all possible values.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "So,in the distribution of this event - rolling a die- where the probability of getting one is 0.17, the probability of getting 2 is 0.17, and so on... all possible values have been exhausted when the sum of probabilities is equal to 1 or 100%. For all other values, the probability of occurrence is 0. This type of distribution is called a uniform distribution, where there is an even likelihood of occurance of every possible event [2]\n",

    "##### Intro \n",
    "A chi-square (χ2) is a statistical test that measures how a model compares to actual observed data. A chi-square test is used to help determine if observed results are in line with expected results, and to rule out that observations are due to chance. It can examine the differences between categorical variables from a random sample in order to judge goodness of fit between expected and observed results. The data used in calculating a chi-square statistic must be random, raw, mutually exclusive, drawn from independent variables, and drawn from a large enough sample. For example, the results of tossing a fair coin meet these criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Uses\n",
    "\n",
    "Chi-square tests are often used in hypothesis testing. The chi-square statistic compares the size of any discrepancies between the expected results and the actual results, given the size of the sample and the number of variables in the relationship. It is appropriate to use this test when the data being analysed is from a random sample and the variable in question is a categorical variable (i.e. one that consists of selections such as type of car, race, gender, etc). These nominal variables differ by quality, and cannot be numerically ordered.\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "Since this sort of data is often collected via surveys or questionnaires, chi-square analysis is often most useful for this sort of analysis. This can be research in areas as varied as demography, psychology, consumer research or political science and economics. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### DF \n",
    "For these tests, degrees of freedom are utilized to determine if a certain null hypothesis can be rejected based on the total number of variables and samples within the experiment. Degrees of freedom is simply the number of independent pieces of information that went into calculating the estimate; ie the number of values that are free to vary in a data set and this is simply ***n-1***. As with any statistic, the larger the sample size, the more reliable the results. [2]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of tests\n",
    "There are two main kinds of chi-square tests: the test of independence, which asks a question of relationship; and the goodness-of-fit test, which asks something like \"How well does the coin in my hand match a theoretically fair coin?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Goodness-of-Fit:\n",
    "χ2 provides a way to test how well a sample of data matches the (known or assumed) characteristics of the larger population that the sample is intended to represent. This is known as goodness of fit. If the sample data does not fit the expected properties of the population that we are interested in, then we would not want to use this sample to draw conclusions about the larger population.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For example, consider an imaginary coin with exactly a 50/50 chance of landing heads or tails and a real coin that you toss 100 times. If this coin is fair, then it will also have an equal probability of landing on either side, and the expected result of tossing the coin 100 times is that heads will come up 50 times and tails will come up 50 times. In a case like this, χ2 can tell us how well the actual results of 100 coin flips compare to the theoretical model that a fair coin will give 50/50 results. The actual toss could come up 50/50, or 60/40, or even 90/10. The farther away the actual results of the 100 tosses is from 50/50, the less good the fit of this set of tosses is to the theoretical expectation of 50/50, and the more likely we might conclude that this coin is not actually a fair coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Test of Independence:\n",
    "When considering student sex and course choice, a χ2 test for independence could be used. To do this test, the researcher would collect data on the two chosen variables (sex and courses picked) and then compare the frequencies at which male and female students select among the offered classes using a χ2 statistical table. If there is no relationship between sex and course selection (that is, if they are independent), then the actual frequencies at which male and female students select each offered course should be expected to be approximately equal, or conversely, the proportion of male and female students in any selected course should be approximately equal to the proportion of male and female students in the sample. A χ2 test for independence can tell us how likely it is that random chance can explain any observed difference between the actual frequencies in the data and these theoretical expectations.\n",

He originally proposed the distribution as a model for material breaking strength, but recognized the potential of the distribution in his 1951 paper *'A Statistical Distribution Function of Wide Applicability'*. However this distribution had been in use for decades prior by mathematicians, uncluding being used for modelling particle sizes in 1933. [3] \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, it’s commonly used to assess product reliability, analyze life data and model failure times. For example, the Weibull distribution can be used to study: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The lifelimes of medical implants\n",
    "- Factory- produced components such as bearings or capacitors\n",
    "- Failure prediction for many industries\n",
    "- Warranty analysis\n",
    "- Utility servicing\n",
    "- Quality control\n",
    "- Capability analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The Weibull can also fit a wide range of data from many other fields, including: biology, economics, engineering sciences, and hydrology. The analysis isn’t limited to production; it is applicable to the design stage and in-service time as well. In the past, the techniques to perform Weibull analysis by hand were tedious and lengthy. The process has now been replaced by statistical software programs and is the most widely used technique for analyzing lifetimes data in the world today.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major advantages to using Weibull analysis is that it can be used for analyzing lifetimes with very small samples. It also produces an easy-to-understand plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The horizontal axis on a Weibull plot shows lifetimes or aging parameters like mileage, operating times, or cycles of use. The vertical axis shows cumulative (additive total) percentage failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "it should be noted that although it can extremely useful in most cases, the Weibull isn’t an appropriate model for every situation, and sometimes other distributions can be better suited.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Weibull Distribution PDFs\n",
    "***\n",
    "This distribution is unusually versatile continuous probability distribution that can fit an extensive range of distribution shapes. Like the normal distribution, the Weibull distribution describes the probabilities associated with continuous data. However, unlike the normal distribution, it can also model skewed data. In fact, its extreme flexibility allows it to model both left- and right-skewed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " There are two versions of the Weibull probability density function (pdf) in common use: the two parameter pdf and the three parameter pdf. The three-parameter Weibull distribution, unsurprisingly, has three parameters, shape, scale, and threshold. When analysts set the threshold parameter to zero, it is known as the two-parameter Weibull distribution. The two parameter Weibull is used in failure analysis, because no failure can occur before time zero. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weibull Threshold Parameter (γ)\n",
    "***\n",
    "The threshold parameter defines the lowest possible value in a Weibull distribution. Some analysts refer to this parameter as the location. All values must be greater than the threshold. Consequently, negative threshold values let the distribution handle both negative and positive values. Zero allows it to contain only positive values. A two-parameter Weibull distribution simply has the threshold set to zero. Statisticians denote the threshold parameter with γ.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you hold the shape and scale parameters constant, the threshold shifts the distribution left and right as can be seen below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i0.wp.com/statisticsbyjim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Weibull_threshold.png?w=576&ssl=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weibull Shape Parameter (β, k)\n",
    "Unsurprisingly, the shape parameter describes the shape of your data’s distribution. Statisticians also refer to it as the Weibull slope because its value equals the slope of the line on a probability plot. Statisticians denote the shape parameter using either beta (β) or k.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are  four key ranges of shape values for the Weibull distribution. In these probability distribution plots, The scale and threshold parameters are indentical to highlight the impact of changing the shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shape < 1: Steadily decreasing values\n",
    "Graph of Weibull distribution with a shape parameter of less than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the shape parameter equals 1, the Weibull distribution is equivalent to a two-parameter exponential distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i2.wp.com/statisticsbyjim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Weibull_shape_05.png?w=576&ssl=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shape between 1 and 2.6: Right-skewed\n",
    "\n",
    "A Weibull distribution with a shape value of 2 is a Rayleigh distribution, which is equivalent to a Chi-square distribution with two degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i2.wp.com/statisticsbyjim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Weibull_distribution.png?w=576&ssl=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shape near 3: Approximates a normal distribution.\n",
    "Weibull distribution with a shape parameter of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i1.wp.com/statisticsbyjim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Weibull_shape_3.png?w=576&ssl=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shape > 3.7: Left-skewed\n",
    "Probability distribution plot of a Weibull distribution with a shape of 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i1.wp.com/statisticsbyjim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Weibull_shape_5.png?w=576&ssl=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the study of failure rates, shape values provide critical information about how the failure rate changes over time. When the shape is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- < 1, the failure rate decreases over time\n",
    "- = 1, the failure rate is constant over time.\n",
    "- \\> 1, the failure rate increases over time \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weibull Scale Parameter (η, λ)\n",
    "The scale parameter represents the variability present in the distribution. Changing the scale parameter affects how far the probability distribution stretches out. As you increase the scale, the distribution stretches further right, and the height decreases. Decreasing the scale shrinks the distribution to the left and increases its peak, as shown below. Statisticians denote the scale parameter using either eta (η) or lambda (λ).\n",
    "\n",
    "The below image shows how changing the Weibull scale parameter affects the distribution.\n",

    "### Intro \n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, uniform distribution refers to a type of probability distribution in which all outcomes are equally likely to occur, called symmetric probability. All values, or variables, in the distribution have a constant probability.  This distribution is also known as the rectangular distribution, because of its shape, which is very clearly different compared to something like a normal distribution bell curve. Like a normal distribution, however, the area under the graph is equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "A deck of cards has within it uniform distributions because the likelihood of drawing a heart, a club, a diamond, or a spade is equally likely. A coin also has a uniform distribution because the probability of getting either heads or tails in a coin toss is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The uniform distribution can be visualized as a straight horizontal line, so for a coin flip returning a head or tail, both have a probability p = 0.50 and would be depicted by a line from the y-axis at 0.50. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both forms of the uniform distribution have two parameters, a and b. These values represent the smallest and largest variables in the distribution. The variables in a uniform distribution are called uniform random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This distribution has two types which will be investigated further below: \n",
    "1. The continuous uniform distribution (in the shape of a rectangle).\n",
    "2. the discrete uniform distribution. It still resembles a rectangle but instead of a line, a series of dots represent a known, finite number of outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uses\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysts and researchers use the uniform distribution to model the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rolling dice and coin tosses.\n",
    "- The probability of drawing any card from a deck of cards.\n",
    "- Random sampling because that method depends on population members having equal chances.\n",
    "- P-values in hypothesis tests follow the uniform distribution when the null hypothesis is true under certain conditions.\n",
    "- Random number generators use the uniform distribution because no number should be more common than other numbers.\n",
    "- Radioactive decay of particles over time.\n",
    "- Analysts can use the uniform distribution to approximate new processes when there is insufficient data to estimate the actual distribution of outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other cases, analysts use this distribution because it’s a close approximation and the calculations are simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Its worth noting that the plotted results from rolling a single dice will be discretely uniform, whereas the plotted results (averages) from rolling two or more dice will be normally distributed. The higher the number of single dice rolls the more accurate the data set when plotting the distribution. For example, a dataset of 10 rolls is less likely to resemble an exactly uniform distribution compared to 100 rolls.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discrete Uniform Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "In this distribution type, each discrete value has an equal probability. For example, the chances of obtaining any of the six values on a dice are equal; or the likelihood of picking a particular card from a deck. In a deck of cards, ignoring the jokers, there are 52 cards, which are a set of discrete data (discrete just means individually seperate and distinct). The likelihood of picking 2 of spades is 1/52, or approx 1.9%. Each card in the deck has exactly the same chance of being picked as they are all unique. However, looking at the same dataset, the likelihood of pulling a heart suit is significantly higher- as there are only 4 suits the probability is now just 1/4 or 25%. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For discrete uniform distributions, finding the probability for each outcome is 1/n, where n is the number of outcomes. Rolling dice has six outcomes. Therefore, each one has a likelihood of 1/6 = 0.167. The bar chart below displays the rectangular-shaped distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bar chart of discrete uniform distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://www.statisticshowto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Uniform_discrete_pmf_svg.svg_.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**In a discrete uniform distribution, outcomes are discrete and have the same probability.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous Uniform Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "This models symmetric, continuous data where all equal sized ranges have the same probability. For example, values are equally likely to fall in the range of 0.1 – 0.2 as they are in 0.4 – 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these types of continuous distributions, you obtain probabilities for ranges of values by finding the area under the curve for that range. Usually, that involves complex calculations.\n",
    "However, in continuous uniform distributions,Like these ones the calculations are relatively simple because it involves finding areas of a rectangle instead of a curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "An idealised RNG (random number generator) would be considered a continuous uniform distribution, because every point in range 0.0-1.0 has an equal chance of apprearing, but there is an infinite number of points this range. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, the distribution ranges from 5 to 10, which covers 5 units. The shaded area is one unit out of five or 1 / 5 = 20% of the total area. Hence, the probability for a value falling between 6 and 7 is 0.2. In fact, all one-unit ranges in this distribution have the same likelihood of 0.2. You can use the same method to calculate the probabilities for other sized ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i2.wp.com/statisticsbyjim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/uniform_distribution_continuous.png?w=576&ssl=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several other important continuous distributions, such as the normal distribution, chi-square, and Student's t-distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**In a continuous uniform distribution, outcomes are continuous and infinite.**\n",

    "The Pareto distribution, named after the Italian civil engineer, economist, and sociologist Vilfredo Pareto, is a power-law probability distribution that is used in description of social, quality control, scientific, geophysical, actuarial, and many other types of observable phenomena. Originally applied to describing the distribution of wealth in a society, fitting the trend that a large portion of wealth is held by a small fraction of the population. The Pareto principle or \"80-20 rule\" stating that 80% of outcomes are due to 20% of causes was named in honour of Pareto, but the concepts are distinct, and only Pareto distributions with shape value (α) of log45 ≈ 1.16 precisely reflect it. Empirical observation has shown that this 80-20 distribution fits a wide range of cases, including natural phenomena and human activities.\n",

    "\n",
    "What is Pareto Distribution?\n",
    "The Pareto Distribution was named after Italian economist and sociologist Vilfredo Pareto. It is sometimes referred to as the Pareto Principle or the 80-20 Rule. The Pareto Distribution is used in describing social, scientific, and geophysical phenomena in society. Pareto created a mathematical formula in the early 20th century that described the inequalities in wealth distribution that existed in his native country of Italy.\n",

    "Pareto Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Pareto observed that 80% of the country’s wealth was concentrated in the hands of only 20% of the population. The theory is now applied in many disciplines such as incomes, productivity, populations, and other variables. The Pareto distribution serves to show that the level of inputs and outputs is not always equal.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "History of Pareto Distribution\n",
    "The Pareto Distribution principle was first employed in Italy in the early 20th century to describe the distribution of wealth among the population. In 1906, Vilfredo Pareto introduced the concept of the Pareto Distribution when he observed that 20% of the pea pods were responsible for 80% of the peas planted in his garden.\n",
    "\n",
    "He related this phenomenon to the nature of wealth distribution in Italy, and he found that 80% of the country’s wealth was owned by about 20% of its population. In terms of land ownership, the Italian observed that 80% of the land was owned by a handful of wealthy citizens, who comprised about 20% of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of the Pareto Distribution was later expanded in the 1940s by Dr. Joseph M. Juran, a prominent product quality guru. Juran applied the Pareto principle to quality control for business production to show that 20% of the production process defects are responsible for 80% of the problems in most products.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Juran, focusing on the 20% causes of defects allowed organizations to implement more effective quality control measures and make better use of their resources. Juran’s additions to the Pareto distribution concept were contained in his 1951 book titled “Quality Control Handbook.”\n",

    "Pareto Distribution Formula\n",
    "The formula for calculating the Pareto Distribution is as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "F(x) = 1 – (k/x)α\n",

    "x – Random variable\n",
    "k – Lower bound on data\n",

    "The chart is defined by the variables α and x. It provides two main applications. One of the applications is to model the distribution of wealth among individuals in a country. The chart shows the extent to which a large portion of wealth in any country is owned by a small percentage of the people living in that country.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second application is to model the distribution of city populations, where a large percentage of the population is concentrated in the urban centers and a lower amount in the rural areas. The population in urban centers continues to increase while the rural population continues to decline as younger members of the population migrate to urban centers.\n",

    "Practical Applications of the Pareto Distribution\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Business Management\n",
    "One of the applications of the Pareto concept is in business management. A business may observe that 20% of the effort dedicated to a specific business activity generates 80% of the business results. A business can use this ratio to identify the most important segments that it can focus on and thereby increase its efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if marketing contributed to increased business results, the business can allocate more time and resources to marketing activities to increase the company’s revenues and profits.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Company Revenues\n",
    "The 80-20 Pareto rule may also apply in evaluating the source of the company revenues. For example, when the company observes that 80% of reported annual revenues come from 20% of its current customers, it can focus its attention on increasing the customer satisfaction of influential customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this observation, the company can also deduce that 80% of customer complaints come from 20% of customers who form the bulk of its transactions. Also, focusing on solving the complaints of 20% of its customers can increase the overall customer satisfaction of the company. The company should focus on retaining 20% of its influential customers and on acquiring new customers.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Employee Evaluation\n",
    "A company can also use the 80-20 rule to evaluate the performance of its employees. The company may observe that 80% of its overall output is the direct result of about 20% of its employees. Using the ratio, the company can focus on rewarding the 20% most productive employees as a way of motivating them and encouraging the lower cluster of employees to work harder. The productivity ratio could also show the company that 80% of human resource problems are caused by 20% of the company’s employees.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations of the Pareto Distribution\n",
    "While the 80-20 Pareto distribution rule applies to many disciplines, it does not necessarily mean that the input and output must be equal to 100%. For example, 20% of the company’s customers could contribute 70% of the company’s revenues. The ratio brings a total of 90%. It shows that the Pareto concept is merely an observation that suggests that the company should focus on certain inputs more than others.\n",

    "The Lomax distribution is a heavy tailed distribution originally proposed by Lomax (1987), who used it in his analysis of business failure lifetime data. The distribution, which is basically a shifted Pareto distribution, is widely used in survival analysis, and has many applications in actuarial science, economics, and business.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lomax distribution, conditionally also called the Pareto Type II distribution, is a heavy-tail probability distribution used in business, economics, actuarial science, queueing theory and Internet traffic modeling.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters\n",
