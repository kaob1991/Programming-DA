    "\n",
    "There are a number of distinct functions within the package that perform a wide variety of high- level mathematical operations on multidimensional numerical arrays. In recent years Numpy has become particularly important for machine learning and deep learning, as these often involve large datasets of numerical data. The cleaning and reshaping of data is a large part of the workflow when dealing with these datasets and numpy can provide some excellent tools to aid in this data manipulation[1]  [4]\n",

    "Among these functions is the numpy.random package which can generate pseudo-random numbers. This is useful for many aspects of data analytics and machine learning projects, from randomly initialing weights in an artificial neural network, splitting data into random sets, or randomly shuffling your dataset, being able to generate random numbers (actually, repeatable pseudo-random numbers) is essential. **Random sampling is used in many tasks related to data analysis, statistics and other related fields, and is very commonly seen in probability, Bayesian statistics (“Bayesian statistics is a mathematical procedure that applies probabilities to statistical problems. It provides people the tools to update their beliefs in the evidence of new data.”), machine learning, among others  (Check this sentence out for improvements)**\n",

    "The numpy package can also offer a few extra probability distributions, such as binomial, commonly used in scientific research, as well as a couple of convenience functions for generating arrays of random data.

Since June 2021. shuffle now uses ```axis``` as a parameter to manipulate the sub-arrays, ie if axis is set at 0 then only the first dimension of arrays will shuffle around. However if it is set to 1 or any other sub-array level, then the first level will set as they were and it is only the values in the dimension called that will move. As this can be a difficult thing to abstractly visualise, I have laid out the following examples below to help visualise the dimensions. \n",

    "Distributions are collections of data, or scores, on a variable. It is a function that shows the possible values for a variable, and how often they occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution provides a parameterized mathematical function that can be used to calculate the probability for any individual observation from the sample space. This distribution describes the grouping or the density of the observations, called the probability density function, or PDF. We can also calculate the likelihood of an observation having a value equal to or lesser than a given value. A summary of these relationships between observations is called a cumulative density function, or CDF.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Many data samples conform to well-known and well-understood mathematical functions, such as the Gaussian distribution. A function can fit the data with a modification of the parameters of the function, such as the mean and standard deviation in the case of the Gaussian.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a distribution function is known, it can be used as a shorthand for describing and calculating related quantities, such as likelihoods of observations, and plotting the relationship between observations in the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Density Functions\n",
    "***\n",
    "Distributions are often described in terms of their density or density functions.These are functions that describe how the proportion of data or likelihood of the proportion of observations change over the range of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two types of density functions are probability density functions and cumulative density functions.These are continuous functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probability Density function:** calculates the probability of observing a given value. It can also be used to summarize the likelihood of observations across the distribution’s sample space. Plots of the PDF show the familiar shape of a distribution, such as the bell-curve for the Gaussian distribution. Distributions are often defined in terms of their probability density functions with their associated parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cumulative Density function:** calculates the probability of an observation equal or less than a value. Cumulative density function, or CDF, is a different way of thinking about the likelihood of observed values. The CDF calculates the cumulative likelihood for the observation and all prior observations in the sample space. It allows a user to quickly understand and comment on how much of the distribution lies before and after a given value. A CDF is often plotted as a curve from 0 to 1 for the distribution.\n",

    "### Probability\n",
    "The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1, where, roughly speaking, 0 indicates impossibility of the event and 1 indicates certainty. [3]\n",

    "Using the concept of a dice is one of the simplest ways to understand probability. It has six sides, numbered from 1 to 6. If the dice is rolled, the probability of getting 1 is one in 6, i.e. one-sixth. This is also true for the other 5 sides. The probability of getting a 7, which obviously is impossible, is 0. The distribution consists not only of the input values that can be observed, but is made up of all possible values.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "So,in the distribution of this event - rolling a die- where the probability of getting one is 0.17, the probability of getting 2 is 0.17, and so on... all possible values have been exhausted when the sum of probabilities is equal to 1 or 100%. For all other values, the probability of occurrence is 0. This type of distribution is called a uniform distribution, where there is an even likelihood of occurance of every possible event [2]\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy’s random number routines produce pseudo random numbers using combinations of a BitGenerator to create sequences and a Generator to use those sequences to sample from different statistical distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "BitGenerators: Objects that generate random numbers. These are typically unsigned integer words filled with sequences of either 32 or 64 random bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators: Objects that transform sequences of random bits from a BitGenerator into sequences of numbers that follow a specific probability distribution (such as uniform, Normal or Binomial) within a specified interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Numpy version 1.17.0 the Generator can be initialized with a number of different BitGenerators. It exposes many different probability distributions. See NEP 19 for context on the updated random Numpy number routines. The legacy RandomState random number routines are still available, but limited to a single BitGenerator. See What’s New or Different for a complete list of improvements and differences from the legacy RandomState.\n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience and backward compatibility, a single RandomState instance’s methods are imported into the numpy.random namespace, see Legacy Random Generation for the complete list."
