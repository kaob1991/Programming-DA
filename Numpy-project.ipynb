In recent years Numpy has become particularly important for machine learning and deep learning, as these often involve large datasets of numerical data.

This is useful for many aspects of data analytics and machine learning projects, from randomly initialing weights in an artificial neural network, splitting data into random sets, or randomly shuffling your dataset, being able to generate random numbers (actually, repeatable pseudo-random numbers) is essential. **Random sampling is used in many tasks related to data analysis, statistics and other related fields, and is very commonly seen in probability, Bayesian statistics (“Bayesian statistics is a mathematical procedure that applies probabilities to statistical problems. It provides people the tools to update their beliefs in the evidence of new data.”), machine learning, among others  (Check this sentence out for improvements)**\n",

This distribution describes the grouping or the density of the observations, called the probability density function, or PDF.They can also be used to calculate the likelihood of an observation having a value equal to or lesser than a given value. A summary of these relationships between observations is called a cumulative density function, or CDF.[1]\n",

    "### Intro [1] [3]\n",
    "A chi-square (χ2) is a statistical test that measures how a model compares to actual observed data. A chi-square test is used to help determine if observed results are in line with expected results, and to rule out that observations are due to chance. It can examine the differences between categorical variables from a random sample in order to judge goodness of fit between expected and observed results. The data used in calculating a chi-square statistic must be random, raw, mutually exclusive, drawn from independent variables, and drawn from a large enough sample. For example, the results of tossing a fair coin meet these criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Uses\n",
    "\n",
    "Chi-square tests are often used in hypothesis testing. The chi-square statistic compares the size of any discrepancies between the expected results and the actual results, given the size of the sample and the number of variables in the relationship. It is appropriate to use this test when the data being analysed is from a random sample and the variable in question is a categorical variable (i.e. one that consists of selections such as type of car, race, gender, etc). These nominal variables differ by quality, and cannot be numerically ordered.\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "Since this sort of data is often collected via surveys or questionnaires, chi-square analysis is often most useful for this sort of analysis. This can be research in areas as varied as demography, psychology, consumer research or political science and economics. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### DF \n",
    "For these tests, degrees of freedom are utilized to determine if a certain null hypothesis can be rejected based on the total number of variables and samples within the experiment. Degrees of freedom is simply the number of independent pieces of information that went into calculating the estimate; ie the number of values that are free to vary in a data set and this is simply ***n-1***. As with any statistic, the larger the sample size, the more reliable the results. [2]\n",

    "#### Types of tests\n",
    "There are two main kinds of chi-square tests: the test of independence, which asks a question of relationship; and the goodness-of-fit test, which asks something like \"How well does the coin in my hand match a theoretically fair coin?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Goodness-of-Fit:\n",
    "χ2 provides a way to test how well a sample of data matches the (known or assumed) characteristics of the larger population that the sample is intended to represent. This is known as goodness of fit. If the sample data does not fit the expected properties of the population that the study are interested in, then this sample should not be to draw conclusions about the larger population.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For example, consider an imaginary coin with exactly a 50/50 chance of landing heads or tails and a real coin tossed 100 times. If this coin is fair, then it will also have an equal probability of landing on either side, and the expected result of tossing the coin 100 times is that heads will come up 50 times and tails will come up 50 times. In a case like this, χ2 can tell us how well the actual results of 100 coin flips compare to the theoretical model that a fair coin will give 50/50 results. The actual toss could come up 50/50, or 60/40, or even 90/10. The farther away the actual results of the 100 tosses is from 50/50, the less good the fit of this set of tosses is to the theoretical expectation of 50/50, and that might allow a conclusion to be made that this coin is not actually a fair coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Test of Independence:\n",
    "When considering student sex and course choice, a χ2 test for independence could be used. To do this test, the researcher would collect data on the two chosen variables (sex and courses picked) and then compare the frequencies at which male and female students select among the offered classes using a χ2 statistical table. If there is no relationship between sex and course selection (that is, if they are independent), then the actual frequencies at which male and female students select each offered course should be expected to be approximately equal, or conversely, the proportion of male and female students in any selected course should be approximately equal to the proportion of male and female students in the sample. A χ2 test for independence can tell us how likely it is that random chance can explain any observed difference between the actual frequencies in the data and these theoretical expectations.\n",

He originally proposed the distribution as a model for material breaking strength, but recognized the potential of the distribution in his 1951 paper *'A Statistical Distribution Function of Wide Applicability'*. However this distribution had been in use for decades prior by mathematicians, uncluding being used for modelling particle sizes in 1933. [3] \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, it’s commonly used to assess product reliability, analyze life data and model failure times. For example, the Weibull distribution can be used to study: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The lifelimes of medical implants\n",
    "- Factory- produced components such as bearings or capacitors\n",
    "- Failure prediction for many industries\n",
    "- Warranty analysis\n",
    "- Utility servicing\n",
    "- Quality control\n",
    "- Capability analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The Weibull can also fit a wide range of data from many other fields, including: biology, economics, engineering sciences, and hydrology. The analysis isn’t limited to production; it is applicable to the design stage and in-service time as well. In the past, the techniques to perform Weibull analysis by hand were tedious and lengthy. The process has now been replaced by statistical software programs and is the most widely used technique for analyzing lifetimes data in the world today.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major advantages to using Weibull analysis is that it can be used for analyzing lifetimes with very small samples. It also produces an easy-to-understand plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The horizontal axis on a Weibull plot shows lifetimes or aging parameters like mileage, operating times, or cycles of use. The vertical axis shows cumulative (additive total) percentage failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "it should be noted that although it can extremely useful in most cases, the Weibull isn’t an appropriate model for every situation, and sometimes other distributions can be better suited.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Weibull Distribution PDFs\n",
    "***\n",
    "This distribution is unusually versatile continuous probability distribution that can fit an extensive range of distribution shapes. Like the normal distribution, the Weibull distribution describes the probabilities associated with continuous data. However, unlike the normal distribution, it can also model skewed data. In fact, its extreme flexibility allows it to model both left- and right-skewed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " There are two versions of the Weibull probability density function (pdf) in common use: the two parameter pdf and the three parameter pdf. The three-parameter Weibull distribution, unsurprisingly, has three parameters, shape, scale, and threshold. When analysts set the threshold parameter to zero, it is known as the two-parameter Weibull distribution. The two parameter Weibull is used in failure analysis, because no failure can occur before time zero. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weibull Threshold Parameter (γ)\n",
    "***\n",
    "The threshold parameter defines the lowest possible value in a Weibull distribution. Some analysts refer to this parameter as the location. All values must be greater than the threshold. Consequently, negative threshold values let the distribution handle both negative and positive values. Zero allows it to contain only positive values. A two-parameter Weibull distribution simply has the threshold set to zero. Statisticians denote the threshold parameter with γ.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you hold the shape and scale parameters constant, the threshold shifts the distribution left and right as can be seen below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i0.wp.com/statisticsbyjim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Weibull_threshold.png?w=576&ssl=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weibull Shape Parameter (β, k)\n",
    "Unsurprisingly, the shape parameter describes the shape of your data’s distribution. Statisticians also refer to it as the Weibull slope because its value equals the slope of the line on a probability plot. Statisticians denote the shape parameter using either beta (β) or k.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are  four key ranges of shape values for the Weibull distribution. In these probability distribution plots, The scale and threshold parameters are indentical to highlight the impact of changing the shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shape < 1: Steadily decreasing values\n",
    "Graph of Weibull distribution with a shape parameter of less than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the shape parameter equals 1, the Weibull distribution is equivalent to a two-parameter exponential distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i2.wp.com/statisticsbyjim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Weibull_shape_05.png?w=576&ssl=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shape between 1 and 2.6: Right-skewed\n",
    "\n",
    "A Weibull distribution with a shape value of 2 is a Rayleigh distribution, which is equivalent to a Chi-square distribution with two degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i2.wp.com/statisticsbyjim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Weibull_distribution.png?w=576&ssl=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shape near 3: Approximates a normal distribution.\n",
    "Weibull distribution with a shape parameter of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i1.wp.com/statisticsbyjim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Weibull_shape_3.png?w=576&ssl=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shape > 3.7: Left-skewed\n",
    "Probability distribution plot of a Weibull distribution with a shape of 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i1.wp.com/statisticsbyjim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Weibull_shape_5.png?w=576&ssl=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the study of failure rates, shape values provide critical information about how the failure rate changes over time. When the shape is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- < 1, the failure rate decreases over time\n",
    "- = 1, the failure rate is constant over time.\n",
    "- \\> 1, the failure rate increases over time \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weibull Scale Parameter (η, λ)\n",
    "The scale parameter represents the variability present in the distribution. Changing the scale parameter affects how far the probability distribution stretches out. As you increase the scale, the distribution stretches further right, and the height decreases. Decreasing the scale shrinks the distribution to the left and increases its peak, as shown below. Statisticians denote the scale parameter using either eta (η) or lambda (λ).\n",
    "\n",
    "The below image shows how changing the Weibull scale parameter affects the distribution.\n",

    "### Intro \n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, uniform distribution refers to a type of probability distribution in which all outcomes are equally likely to occur, called symmetric probability. All values, or variables, in the distribution have a constant probability.  This distribution is also known as the rectangular distribution, because of its shape, which is very clearly different compared to something like a normal distribution bell curve. Like a normal distribution, however, the area under the graph is equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "A deck of cards has within it uniform distributions because the likelihood of drawing a heart, a club, a diamond, or a spade is equally likely. A coin also has a uniform distribution because the probability of getting either heads or tails in a coin toss is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The uniform distribution can be visualized as a straight horizontal line, so for a coin flip returning a head or tail, both have a probability p = 0.50 and would be depicted by a line from the y-axis at 0.50. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both forms of the uniform distribution have two parameters, a and b. These values represent the smallest and largest variables in the distribution. The variables in a uniform distribution are called uniform random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This distribution has two types which will be investigated further below: \n",
    "1. The continuous uniform distribution (in the shape of a rectangle).\n",
    "2. the discrete uniform distribution. It still resembles a rectangle but instead of a line, a series of dots represent a known, finite number of outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uses\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysts and researchers use the uniform distribution to model the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rolling dice and coin tosses.\n",
    "- The probability of drawing any card from a deck of cards.\n",
    "- Random sampling because that method depends on population members having equal chances.\n",
    "- P-values in hypothesis tests follow the uniform distribution when the null hypothesis is true under certain conditions.\n",
    "- Random number generators use the uniform distribution because no number should be more common than other numbers.\n",
    "- Radioactive decay of particles over time.\n",
    "- Analysts can use the uniform distribution to approximate new processes when there is insufficient data to estimate the actual distribution of outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other cases, analysts use this distribution because it’s a close approximation and the calculations are simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Its worth noting that the plotted results from rolling a single dice will be discretely uniform, whereas the plotted results (averages) from rolling two or more dice will be normally distributed. The higher the number of single dice rolls the more accurate the data set when plotting the distribution. For example, a dataset of 10 rolls is less likely to resemble an exactly uniform distribution compared to 100 rolls.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discrete Uniform Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "In this distribution type, each discrete value has an equal probability. For example, the chances of obtaining any of the six values on a dice are equal; or the likelihood of picking a particular card from a deck. In a deck of cards, ignoring the jokers, there are 52 cards, which are a set of discrete data (discrete just means individually seperate and distinct). The likelihood of picking 2 of spades is 1/52, or approx 1.9%. Each card in the deck has exactly the same chance of being picked as they are all unique. However, looking at the same dataset, the likelihood of pulling a heart suit is significantly higher- as there are only 4 suits the probability is now just 1/4 or 25%. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For discrete uniform distributions, finding the probability for each outcome is 1/n, where n is the number of outcomes. Rolling dice has six outcomes. Therefore, each one has a likelihood of 1/6 = 0.167. The bar chart below displays the rectangular-shaped distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bar chart of discrete uniform distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://www.statisticshowto.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Uniform_discrete_pmf_svg.svg_.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**In a discrete uniform distribution, outcomes are discrete and have the same probability.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous Uniform Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "This models symmetric, continuous data where all equal sized ranges have the same probability. For example, values are equally likely to fall in the range of 0.1 – 0.2 as they are in 0.4 – 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these types of continuous distributions, you obtain probabilities for ranges of values by finding the area under the curve for that range. Usually, that involves complex calculations.\n",
    "However, in continuous uniform distributions,Like these ones the calculations are relatively simple because it involves finding areas of a rectangle instead of a curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "An idealised RNG (random number generator) would be considered a continuous uniform distribution, because every point in range 0.0-1.0 has an equal chance of apprearing, but there is an infinite number of points this range. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, the distribution ranges from 5 to 10, which covers 5 units. The shaded area is one unit out of five or 1 / 5 = 20% of the total area. Hence, the probability for a value falling between 6 and 7 is 0.2. In fact, all one-unit ranges in this distribution have the same likelihood of 0.2. You can use the same method to calculate the probabilities for other sized ranges.\n",

    "\n",
    "![](https://i2.wp.com/statisticsbyjim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/uniform_distribution_continuous.png?w=576&ssl=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several other important continuous distributions, such as the normal distribution, chi-square, and Student's t-distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**In a continuous uniform distribution, outcomes are continuous and infinite.**\n",

    "## Intro \n",
    "\n",
    "The Pareto distribution, named after the Italian civil engineer, economist, and sociologist Vilfredo Pareto, is a power-law probability distribution introduced in 1906. Pareto obvserved that 20% of pea pods were responsible for 80% of peas. He related this phenomenon to the nature of wealth distribution in Italy, and he found that 80% of the country’s wealth and land ownership was owned by about 20% of its population. Empirical observation has shown that this 80-20 distribution fits a wide range of cases, including natural phenomena and human activities. For example, the Gutenberg-Richter Law says that the magnitudes of earthquakes in a given region are Pareto distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Pareto distribution is sometimes referred to as a power law distribution. Generically, a distribution is said to be a power law distribution if a relative change in one quantity results in a proportional relative change in the other quantity. This change is independant of the initial size of those quantities- one quantity varies as a power of another. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## Uses\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pareto Distribution can be used to model the size or ranks of objects chosen randomly from certain type of populations, for example, the frequency of words in long sequences of text approximately obeys the discrete Pareto I distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This distribution is widely used in describing social, scientific, and geophysical phenomena in society.  The theory is now applied in many disciplines such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Business Management\n",
    "- Productivity\n",
    "- Populations and human settlement\n",
    "- Quality control \n",
    "- Income distribution \n",
    "\n",
    "amongst many other variables. It is seen used in areas as varied as insurance, web page access statistics and oil field sizes. \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to note is that while the 80-20 Pareto distribution rule applies to many disciplines, it does not necessarily mean that the input and output must be equal to 100%. For example, 20% of a company’s customers could contribute only 70% of the company’s revenues. The ratio brings a total of 90%. It shows that the Pareto concept is merely an observation to show that the level of inputs and outputs is not always equal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lomax Distribution (Pareto II)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many variants of the Pareto distribution. Numpy works on the Pareto II, or Lomax distribution, which is a commonly used variation. This is a heavy tailed distribution originally proposed by K.S. Lomax in 1987, who used it in his analysis of business failure lifetime data. It is widely used in survival analysis and has many applications in actuarial science, biological sciences economics, business, queueing theory, internet traffic prediction and even for modelling the distribution of sizes of computer files on servers [8]. The Lomax distribution is essentially a Pareto distribution that has been shifted so that its support begins at zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 parameters that define this distribution: scale parameter λ and shape parameter κ (sometimes denoted as α). The shorthand X ∼ Lomax(λ,κ) indicates the random variable X has a Lomax distribution with those two parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Even within the Lomax Distribution there are many variants - for example, the beta-exponentiated Lomax is a 5-parameter continuous model.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for calculating the Pareto Distribution is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "F(x) = 1 – (k/x)α\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "x – Random variable\n",
    "k – Lower bound on data\n",
    "α – Shape parameter\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "On a chart, the Pareto distribution is represented by a slowly declining tail, as shown below:\n",

    "Draw samples from a Pareto II or Lomax distribution with specified shape. The Pareto distribution must be greater than zero, and is unbounded above. It is also known as the “80-20 rule”. In this distribution, 80 percent of the weights are in the lowest 20 percent of the range, while the other 20 percent fill the remaining 80 percent of the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lomax or Pareto II distribution is a shifted Pareto distribution. The classical Pareto distribution can be obtained from the Lomax distribution by adding 1 and multiplying by the scale parameter ```m```. The smallest value of the Lomax distribution is zero while for the classical Pareto distribution it is the mean (mu), where the standard Pareto distribution has location mu = 1. There are 2 parameters ```a``` which sets the shape of the distribution and must be a positive floar or array of floats. ```size``` is an integer which determines the shape of the output. If none is given then a single value is returned. ```pareto``` returns an array from the distribution set by the parameters. \n",

    "## Student's t-test \n",
    "***\n",
    "## Intro \n",
    "Student's t-distribution was developed by an English statistician called William Sealy Gosset in 1908 under the pseudonym \"Student\". He worked for Guinness in Dublin and was interested in the problems relating to small sample sizes. \n",
    "The t-distribution is a family of continuous probability distributions that arise when estimating the mean of a normally-distributed population in situations where the sample size is small and the population's standard deviation is unknown. The distributions look almost identical to normal distribution, only a bit shorter and fatter. The larger the sample size, the closer the distribution resembles a bell curve. \n",
    "\n",
    "The t test is based on an assumption that the data comes from a Normal distribution. The t test provides a way to test whether the sample mean (that is the mean calculated from the data) is a good estimate of the true mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "T-distributions can be used to analyze one or two sample means. Depending on the t-test used, a sample mean can be compared to a hypothesized value, the means of two independent samples, or the difference between paired samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "The paper written by Gosset refers to the distribution as the \"frequency distribution of standard deviations of samples drawn from a normal population\". It became well known through the work of Ronald Fisher, who also created the Fisher's Iris dataset. It was he who called the distribution \"Student's distribution\" and represented the test value with the letter t.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-distribution plays a role in a number of widely used statistical analyses, including Student's t-test for assessing the statistical significance of the difference between two sample means, the construction of confidence intervals for the difference between two population means, and in linear regression analysis. Student's t-distribution also arises in the Bayesian analysis of data from a normal family.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### T-values\n",
    "\n",
    "The term “t-test” refers to the fact that these hypothesis tests use t-values to evaluate sample data. T-values are a type of test statistic. Hypothesis tests use the test statistic that is calculated from a sample to compare that sample to the null hypothesis. If the test statistic is extreme enough, this indicates that the data is so incompatible with the null hypothesis that the null can be rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "T-distributions assume that the null hypothesis is correct for the population from which the random samples are drawn from. To evaluate how compatible a sample of data is with the null hypothesis, a study’s t-value is placed in the t-distribution and that is determined how unusual it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When data is analysed with any t-test, the procedure reduces the entire sample to a single value, the t-value. These calculations factor in sample size and data variation. Then, the t-test compares the sample means(s) to the null hypothesis condition in the following manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the sample data equals the null hypothesis precisely, the t-test produces a t-value of 0.\n",
    "- As the sample data become progressively dissimilar from the null hypothesis, the absolute value of the t-value increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A single t-test produces a single t-value. To get a t-distribution, t-values are created by drawing many random samples of the same size from the sample population, and t-tests are then performed on all of the samples and the distribution of these t-values is plotted. This distribution is known as a sampling distribution, which is a type of probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is produced using this data that displays the distribution of t-values that are obtained from a population where the null hypothesis is true. Sampling distributions are used to calculate probabilities for how unusual the sample statistic is if the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i1.wp.com/statisticsbyjim.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/tdististribution.png?w=576&ssl=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Statisticians understand the properties of t-distributions so the sampling distribution can be estimated using the t-distribution and sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The degrees of freedom (DF) define the t-distribution for a particular study. As previously mentioned, the DF are closely related to the sample size. For t-tests, there is a different t-distribution for each sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " When the null is true, a study is most likely to obtain a t-value near zero and less liable to produce t-values further from zero in either direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample size for a t-test determines the degrees of freedom (DF) for that test, which specifies the t-distribution. The overall effect is that as the sample size decreases, the tails of the t-distribution become thicker. Thicker tails indicate that t-values are more likely to be far from zero even when the null hypothesis is correct. The changing shapes are how t-distributions factor in the greater uncertainty when you have a smaller sample.\n",

    "## Uses \n",
    "\n",
    "The T Distribution (and the associated t scores), are used in hypothesis testing when you want to figure out if you should accept or reject the null hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, this distribution is used when there is a small sample size (under 30) or the population's standard deviation is unknown. In real world, practical uses, this is nearly always the case so the t-distibution is often used more than a normal distribution. If the size of the sample is large enough, the two distributions are practically the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can also be used in a variety of statistical estimation problems where the goal is to estimate an unknown parameter, such as a mean value, in a setting where the data has known errors. If the population standard deviation of these errors is unknown and has to be estimated from the data, the t-distribution is often used to account for the extra uncertainty that results from this estimation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the Student's t-distribution arises frequently in Bayesian statistics as a result of its connection with the normal distribution. \n",

    "4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.\"\n",
    "***\n",
    "Prior to version 1.17 release in July 2019, NumPy used to use the Mersenne-twister (MT19937) which was developed by Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura in 1997. It is by far the most widely used general purpose pseudorandom number generator (PRNG). used by default in programming languages such as python, R, ruby, PHP; several linux libraries; and programs such as Excel, SageMath, Scilab and MATLAB. Its also used in SPSS and SAS\n",
    "\n",
    "Its name derives from the fact that its period length is chosen to be a Mersenne prime. This is a prime number that is one less than a power of two. The Mersenne Twister was designed specifically to rectify most of the flaws in older PRNG's, such as:\n",
    "- Shorter-than-expected periods for some seed states (such seed states may be called \"weak\" in this context);\n",
    "- Lack of uniformity of distribution for large quantities of generated numbers;\n",
    "- Correlation of successive values;\n",
    "- Poor dimensional distribution of the output sequence;\n",
    "- Distances between where certain values occur are distributed differently from those in a random sequence distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are both advantages and disadvantages to the Mersenne-twister generator. Some advantages include: \n",
    "- Patent-free for most variants\n",
    "- Passes numerous tests for statistical randomness\n",
    "- Very long period of 2<sup>19937</sup> (while a long period is not a guaranteee of quality in a RNG, short periods can be problematic)\n",
    "- Speed- The Mersenne Twister can create 64bit random floats approx 20 times faster than a processor-based RDRAND instruction\n",
    "Disadvantages include:\n",
    "- This PRNG requires a relatively large state buffer in most cases\n",
    "- It has a mediocre throughput by modern standards in most cases\n",
    "- Exhibits 2 clear failures (linear complexity) in some randomness tests\n",
    "- Poor diffusion- it can take a long time to start generating output that passes randomness tests.\n",
    "- In most cases, it is not cryptographically secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since then the default Generator in NumPy is PCG64.  A permuted congruential generator (PCG) is a pseudorandom number generation algorithm developed in 2014 which applies an output permutation function to improve the statistical properties of a modulo-2n linear congruential generator. It achieves excellent statistical performance with small and fast code, and small state size. It was developed by applying a test known as TestU01/BigCrush to reduced size variants and determining the minimum number of internal state bits needed to pass. While some very poor generators can pass if given a large enough state, passing with a small state determines quality. One of the PCG's can pass with the minimum possible bits of state. \n",
    "\n",
    "There a number of advantages to using a PCG including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ease of use, and very flexible. \n",
    "- Very powerful features. \n",
    "- Very fast, and can occupy very little space.\n",
    "- It has a small code size.\n",
    "- Excellent performance in statistical tests. \n",
    "- It's much less predictable and thus more secure than most generators.\n",
    "- It's open source software, with a permissive license \n",
    "\n",
    "In Numpy 1.21 they take a different approach to producing random numbers from the RandomState object\n",
    "Random number generation is separated into two components, a bit generator and a random generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BitGenerator has a limited set of responsibilities. It manages state and provides functions to produce random doubles and random unsigned 32- and 64-bit values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The random generator takes the bit generator-provided stream and transforms them into more useful distributions, e.g., simulated normal random values. This structure allows alternative bit generators to be used with little code duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Generator is the user-facing object that is nearly identical to the legacy RandomState. It accepts a bit generator instance as an argument. The default is currently PCG64 but this may change in future versions. As a convenience NumPy provides the default_rng function to hide these details:\n",

    "PCG-64 is a 128-bit implementation of O’Neill’s permutation congruential generator ([1], [2]). PCG-64 has a period of  and supports advancing an arbitrary number of steps as well as  streams.

    "The PCG64 state vector consists of 2 unsigned 128-bit values, which are represented externally as Python ints. One is the state of the PRNG, which is advanced by a linear congruential generator (LCG). The second is a fixed odd increment used in the LCG.\n",
